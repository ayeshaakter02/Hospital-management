          My health journey has been marked by challenges and triumphs. It all
          began in 2022 with abdominal and back pain, leading to a diagnosis of
          peripheral canal perforation. Subsequent tests like MRI, endoscopy,
          and colonoscopy uncovered cysts and gallstones. Thanks to the
          successful treatment at <b>Life-care Hospital</b>, Maghbazar, I enjoyed two
          years of good health. During this period, I also underwent effective
          treatment for tuberculosis, which was completely cured. However, my
          health took a sudden turn on 2024 when I developed a fever and
          struggled to eat. This prompted my admission to the medicine ward at
          AMCH. Fortunately, the dedicated doctors and nurses at AMCH, along
          with appropriate medication, facilitated my recovery from these
          symptoms. Their expertise and care played a crucial role in restoring
          my health once again. <b>Monoara Begum, housewife, Rupgonj Gaulsia,

          I experienced sudden vaginal bleeding that started out, with no
          abdominal pain. By noon, the bleeding became more severe and was
          accompanied by mild lower abdominal pain. After being diagnosed with
          placenta previa—meaning my placenta was either partially or fully
          covering the lower part of my uterus—I underwent surgery at <b>Life-care
          Medical College Hospital (AMCH)</b>. I’m relieved to say that both my baby
          and I are now safe and doing well. <b>Mrs. Tanisha, 24, Housewife,

          I am very thankful to <b>Life-care Hospital</b> for their exceptional medical
          care and continuous assistance. Despite receiving multiple treatments,
          my baby had a high fever, persistent cough, and concerning chest
          noises. After visiting <b>Life-care Hospital</b>, the experienced team swiftly
          diagnosed and properly treated the issue. My baby is now fever-free,
          cough-free, and his chest sounds have stopped. <b>Gopal Das, 8 month,

          I am deeply grateful to <b>Life-care Hospital</b> at Moghbazar for the
          exceptional care my child received. After battling pneumonia and a
          subsequent lung infection for over a year with no improvement from
          previous treatments, we turned to <b>Life-care Hospital</b>. The difference was
          remarkable. Within just 15 days, my son’s breathing improved
          significantly, and after three months, he made a full recovery. The
          hospital’s commitment to providing free food and medicines was an
          added blessing during a challenging time. The dedicated team at Life-care
          Hospital restored my child’s health and gave our family hope. I highly
          recommend <b>Life-care Hospital</b> for their outstanding care and support.

          I recently had surgery for a fistula at <b>Life-care Hospital</b> at Moghbazar,
          and the experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment I
          arrived, the staff’s genuine care and professionalism were evident.
          The surgery went smoothly, and I’m now on the road to recovery. I’m
          deeply grateful for the exceptional care and support provided by the
          team at Addin Hospital. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking
          top-notch medical attention. <b>Sharif Hossain, 31, Dawdkandi, Comilla</b>
